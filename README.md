Examples differs from the web so better checking in the RC local help in the installation folder. I saw many diffences in commands.


I am not able to export the model which I will test next.

Second I will test how to make the video to sequence because I do record videos many times because it is quick and easy. 

It will not be highest quality but you can get decent results it.



Add following line before "exit" in first bat file to start second bat. you can keep as many you like

start cmd /k CALL C:\path\to\second.bat 



Run the bat and go to sleep. Cleanup the models in the morning and have fun.
Keep watching for the updates
